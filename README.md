Review for Work Done on 18th June:

On 18th June, you practiced HTML table concepts by creating two separate files:

tables.html – This file likely contains basic HTML table structure, showcasing how to create rows, columns, headers, and data 

cells using <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td> tags.

rowspan and coloumnspan.html – This file demonstrates the use of rowspan and colspan attributes to merge cells across multiple rows and columns, improving table layout and presentation.

This activity helped reinforce your understanding of HTML tables, especially advanced cell formatting and structure organization.

Review for Work Done on 19th June:

On 19th June, you focused on enhancing your HTML skills by working on forms and updating previous table work:

forms.html – Created a basic HTML form demonstrating input types like text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, and buttons. This helped solidify your understanding of how to capture user data.

formaassignment.html – Built a more structured or real-world form (possibly an assignment task) that showcases practical use of various form elements, layout organization, and perhaps validation attributes.

Modified rowspan and coloumnspan.html – Revisited and updated your table merging concepts, possibly refining the layout or correcting earlier issues with rowspan and colspan.

This set of tasks gave you hands-on experience with form handling and advanced table structures, both of which are foundational for any web development project.
